# Image-Threshold
A utility to test threshold values with different image formats. Originally created for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree's Advanced Lane Finding project.
With this application you can load a folder containing JPG images and view them in BGR, HLS, HSV, YUV and YCrCb formats, and select one of the three different channels. It also has a binary window where you can apply a threshold in order to see how it affects to the selected channel output.
